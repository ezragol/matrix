# Matrix Calculator
work in progress matrix/vector calculator

matrices:
- determinant of a matrix
- matrix transposing
- minors/cofactors of a matrix
- add matrices
- multiply matrices
- scalar multiply matrices

vectors:
- get vector magnitudes
- find the cross product of two 3d vectors
- find the dot product of two 3d vectors
- find the unit vector of a 2d/3d vector
- alpha/beta/gamma angles for 3d vectors

lacks:
- better error handling
- need to figure out of returning vectors is good/bad
- figure out how to package as a library
- rref/trace/powers [-, +] for matrices (inverses)

future:
- probably convert to rust library
- or javascript library
